Many major tech companies, including Netflix, PayPal, LinkedIn,
and Uber, use Node.js to power their applications.

Netflix,  for example, switched from Java to Node.js to improve startup
speeds and enhance server performance, leading to a more responsive
user experience.

PayPal also reported significant improvements
in response time and developer productivity after adopting Node.js, proving its efficiency
for large-scale applications.

NASA uses Node.js to enhance data processing and improve astronaut
safety by centralizing mission-critical data into a single cloud database.

Uber uses Node.js to handle real-time data processing and ensure fast
and efficient communication between drivers and riders.
Its event-driven architecture helps Uber scale its services globally.

LinkedIn migrated from Ruby on Rails to Node.js for its mobile backend,
leading to a tenfold reduction in the number of servers and improved performance.
